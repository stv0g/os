# Coding style rules

## File format

All text files are encoded by UTF-8.
Use tabs for indention.

## Functions

## Documentation

For documentation doxygen is used.
Use the Javadoc syntax to document every global function, type and
variable in its correspondending header file.

## Filenames

We use lowercase filenames.
They should be kept as short as possible.
